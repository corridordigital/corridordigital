## My tech stack: 
I usually just learn whatever tool I need to use, as I consider myself a polymath. Still, I've been using these for years now: 
* Python, R, bash
* SQL, dbt, Airflow
* Linux, Ansible, Terraform, Docker
* Google Cloud Platform services (Cloud Run, BigQuery, etc.)
* A bunch of libraries related to data processing, machine learning, forecasting, etc.
